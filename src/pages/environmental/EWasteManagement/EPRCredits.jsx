These credits are then made available for purchase on the centralized CPCB portal.",
                            "Producers, importers, and brand owners (PIBOs) who are unable to physically collect and recycle their entire EPR target can purchase these credits from authorized recyclers to meet their mandated Extended Producer Responsibility obligations.",

                            "Each EPR credit represents 1 metric tonne of waste that has been collected and processed by an authorized recycler. The credit is generated on the CPCB portal after the recycler submits processed quantity data, which is validated and certified by the third-party auditor appointed by CPCB."
