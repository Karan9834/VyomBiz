                    "Defamation is the act of communicating a false statement to a third party that results in damaging a person's reputation. It is the act of giving false information about a person that can harm their reputation, lower respect for them, or lead to bad opinions or sentiments against them. Defamation can either be criminal or civil. Types of defamation include libel, slander, false statement, publication, criminal defamation, and civil defamation.",
                    "Defamation litigation involves addressing harm caused by defamatory statements and false claims that damage a person’s reputation. Whether spoken (slander refers) or written (libel generally refers to written or printed words), such statements can have serious consequences. In defamation law, a false statement that is considered defamatory must be made to a third person and result in serious harm or serious financial loss. Both libel and slander fall under defamation and may give rise to a defamation claim, defamation suit, or defamation action in appropriate judicial proceedings.",

                        question: "What should I do if I get charged twice for my order?",
                        answer: "If you are charged twice, contact the e-commerce platform's customer support immediately with transaction details. If they fail to refund, you can raise a dispute with your bank or file a consumer complaint."

                        answer: "It is advisable to report the defect immediately. Most platforms have a return window (e.g., 7-30 days). if they refuse to accept the return within this period, you can file a complaint."

                    {
                        question: "Is it possible to take legal action against big e-commerce giants?",
                        answer: "Yes, consumer laws apply to all sellers, regardless of their size. Consumer courts frequently rule in favor of consumers against major e-commerce platforms for service deficiencies."

                        question: "What if the seller refuses to refund money after a return?",
