                        answer: "If you are charged twice, contact the e-commerce platform's customer support immediately with transaction details. If they fail to refund, you can raise a dispute with your bank or file a consumer complaint."

                        answer: "It is advisable to report the defect immediately. Most platforms have a return window (e.g., 7-30 days). if they refuse to accept the return within this period, you can file a complaint."

                        answer: "Yes, consumer laws apply to all sellers, regardless of their size. Consumer courts frequently rule in favor of consumers against major e-commerce platforms for service deficiencies."
